That project is part of the showcase platform for C++ projects.

The common base (in short, 'combase') project contains a purely virtual
C++ class, which serves as a base class for other C++ projects/components.

- The 'trunk' branch contains a simple version of that fundamental component.
  Use that version if you just want to see (the CMake code demonstrating)
  how a component can be exported and imported by other components.
- The 'trunkff' branch (where 'ff' stands for 'full featured') contains a full
  blown component, providing the other components with facilities such as
  logging, database access, documentation (HTML pages, PDF reference manual,
  manual pages) generation, bindings for UI (User Interface), script languages
  (Python) and client/server frameworks.
  Use that version if you want a universal reference for building, testing,
  integrating and delivering your own multi-component projects.
